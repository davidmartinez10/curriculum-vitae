    "summary": "A seasoned programmer with 8+ years of experience in professional application and web development. A problem solver at heart, I started my programming journey as a hobbyist at 12 with the C language. Ever enthusiastic about computing and eager to explore new frontiers and find better ways, I have developed a diverse skill set that includes expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React, and related technologies and tooling, as well as hands-on administration of infrastructure for servers and fault-tolerant distributed databases. I can work with high-level abstractions and simultaneously possess a solid understanding of the inner workings of systems. I have a proven track record of my abilities in designing, developing, and maintaining programs ranging from desktop apps and backend services to web frontends, as well as all kinds of seamless integrations, including blockchains and smart contracts. I enjoy creating elegant solutions and am eager to find the opportunity to apply my talent and expertise to the creation of a good product.",
